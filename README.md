# Block-Drops-Plugin
This plugin allows players to customize the materials that blocks drop on a Minecraft server. 
# Usage
The user shift right clicks a block to open a gui and drags items into the gui. Then, when that type of block is mined, it will drop the items that were set in the gui. It will write the new drop data to the yml files and read them next time the plugin is loaded.
